# AQI-Prediction-Model
Predicting PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations (regression) in cities using available features to support public health and air quality management.
Project primarily focuses on regression because the primary objective is to predict continuous numerical values for air pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NO2), rather than assigning them to discrete categories (classification) or grouping them based on similarity (clustering)
Predicting numbers for how much pollution (PM2.5, PM10, NO2) is in the air in different cities. Knowing these numbers helps people stay healthy and allows cities to make better plans to reduce pollution.
